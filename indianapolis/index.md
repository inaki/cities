### Overview 

_Things that fellows would want to know about the city. Ideas from the Google doc:_

* _Weather, Demographics, Urbanicity_
* _Is there a history of civic engagement? Does the city already have a Brigade?_
* _Community? Transportation (need a car)? Cost of living_
* _Is there a high income-disparity? If so, why/how?_
* _History: Is there a history of suspicion of local government?_
* _Geography. Industry. Blue collar? Hospitality? Creatives moving in? Is it “a city in transition?”_


### Local Government & Allies

* Interesting program: [Indy Metro Police Department's Citizens' Academy](http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/DPS/IMPD/Involved/Pages/citizen.aspx).
* Can't find a Code for Indianapolis brigade.
