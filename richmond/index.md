### Overview

In Richmond over 1 in 4 residents live in poverty, many of which have had minimal or no access to healthcare or medical care. The passing of the Affordable Care Act has created an opportunity to educate, inform and activate a healthier constituency. Many residents have not had access to basic healthcare, such as annual check-ups, access to medicine, or basic preventative healthcare practices.  Richmond wants to improve how the Cityâ€™s new ACA recipients interact and utilize healthcare.
