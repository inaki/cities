#### This project have the intention of gather information about the 2015 Fellow Cities.


We decide to do a simple jekyll site so everybody can contribute, coders and non-coders.
Here Content is the king, so the most important thing is that we get the most valuable information
about the Fellow Cities that will help us before and during the fellowship year. For us, as fellows
is important to know very well about the cities we'll have the opportunity to serve as well as the
cities that other fellows friends are working with so we can work together to get the most useful apps
for the people of this cities this year.

## jekyll site

#### Installing Jekyll

If you don't have jekyll installed, check out the [installation docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). 

Additionally, if you are running an older version of OSX, it's possible that you won't be able to build the site properly because your version of Ruby is too old. If this happens, you can try to [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) the new version of Ruby, and set your PATH to prioritize that one. (`export PATH=export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH`)

#### Running the cities app

 1. **Fork** the repo
 2. **Download** to your local machine
