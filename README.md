#### This project have the intention of gather information about the 2015 Fellow Cities.


We decide to do a simple jekyll site so everybody can contribute, coders and non-coders.
Here Content is the king, so the most important thing is that we get the most valuable information
about the Fellow Cities that will help us before and during the fellowship year. For us, as fellows
is important to know very well about the cities we'll have the opportunity to serve as well as the
cities that other fellows friends are working with so we can work together to get the most useful apps
for the people of this cities this year.
