### Overview 

_Things that fellows would want to know about the city. Ideas from the Google doc:_

* _Weather, Demographics, Urbanicity_
* _Is there a history of civic engagement? Does the city already have a Brigade?_
* _Community? Transportation (need a car)? Cost of living_
* _Is there a high income-disparity? If so, why/how?_
* _History: Is there a history of suspicion of local government?_
* _Geography. Industry. Blue collar? Hospitality? Creatives moving in? Is it “a city in transition?”_

### Allies

_Ideas from the Google doc:_

* _Key city gov departments related to focus topic._
* _Community organizations currently active in focus topic, especially groups that can provide guidance and feedback._
* _Local CfA brigade, civic hackers + former CfA fellows for guidance, feedback, getting up to speed._
