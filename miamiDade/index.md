### Overview 

_Things that fellows would want to know about the city. Ideas from the Google doc:_

* _Weather, Demographics, Urbanicity_
* _Is there a history of civic engagement? Does the city already have a Brigade?_
* _Community? Transportation (need a car)? Cost of living_
* _Is there a high income-disparity? If so, why/how?_
* _History: Is there a history of suspicion of local government?_
* _Geography. Industry. Blue collar? Hospitality? Creatives moving in? Is it “a city in transition?”_


### Allies

_Ideas from the Google doc:_

* _Key city gov departments related to focus topic._
  * [Miami-Dade Community Information and Outreach](http://www.miamidade.gov/information/): [Mike Sarasti is a Program Manager](http://305biz.org/2014/09/29/mike-sarasti-on-open-data-fall-2014/) in this particular department at Miami-Dade County. He's also our municipal partner at Code for Miami and helped bring the Fellows program to the County, so I'm assuming he'll be our chief liason for the fellows. His boss is Henry Sori who is the director of the department.  
* _Community organizations currently active in focus topic, especially groups that can provide guidance and feedback._
  * [The Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/) is based in Miami and is thus a major player here trying to move the city forward. Most folks probably are familiar with the organization as they're a major supporter of Code for America, but they also offer local arts and community grants in Miami. [Program Director Matt Haggman](http://www.knightfoundation.org/staff/matt-haggman/) is a huge community champion and certainly one of the first people fellows should meet.
  * [The Miami Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/) "provides civic leadership, bringing stakeholders together to tackle issues of concern in our community." The person fellows will want to talk with is [Stuart Kennedy](http://miamifoundation.org/page.aspx?pid=620).
  * [The Beacon Council](http://www.beaconcouncil.com/): "As Miami-Dade County's official economic development partnership, The Beacon Council facilitates local, national and international business growth and expansion programs, helping companies of all sizes in diverse industries achieve their goals."
  * [The LAB Miami](http://thelabmiami.com/) was one of the first co-working spaces that opened up in Miami, and since has been seen as a third space for a combination of technology, young creatives, satellite remote workers, community programs and a whole lot of entrapeneurialism. Disclaimer: I (Ernie) have a space here so I am biased.
  * [VentureHive](http://www.venturehive.co/): Co-working space and accellerator. 
  * [Endeavor Miami](http://www.endeavormiami.org/): "Endeavor is the only non-profit that supports high-impact entrepreneurs around the world. Our 'mentor capitalist' model breaks down economic and cultural barriers to entrepreneurship through advising from our network of world-class business leaders." Matt Haggman could set up a proper intro to someone here if need be.
  * [The Idea Center at Miami Dade College](http://www.theideacenter.co/): Relatively new for MDC - which is the largest Junior College in the United States - "The Idea Center @MDC will [...] be the college’s hub for entrepreneurship for 165,000 students. The center will also have a venture incubator, called CREATE, with programming and resources to help nurture and accelerate the entrepreneurial ideas and ventures of students." Worth note: CREATE's director is Wifredo Fernandez, one of the co-founders of LAB Miami. He's worth talking to.
  * [Refresh Miami](www.refreshmiami.com): there are many faces to Miami entrapeneurialism. Tech startups in Miami is nascent - still more "hustler" than "hacker" - but this is the networking group everyone goes to. Worth talking with its founder, Brian Breslin.
* _Local CfA brigade, civic hackers + former CfA fellows for guidance, feedback, getting up to speed._
  * [Code for Miami](http://www.codeformiami.org), local civic hacking brigade which meets every Monday at 7pm in the Wynwood Arts District. Co-captains are [Rebekah Monson](http://www.twitter.com/rsm) and [Cristina Solana](https://twitter.com/nightshiftc), replacing Ernie as he participates in the Fellows program.
