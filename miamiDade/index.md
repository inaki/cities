### Overview 

"Miami-Dade County [is looking] to improve constituent interactions with a focus on economic development and regulatory outcomes, enriching feedback loops and improving access to services. In the process of doing so, they want to make key data sets more open accessible to internal partners and the public."

### Miami-Dade County

Miami-Dade County is [comprised of 34 municipalities](http://www.miamidade.gov/info/library/at-a-glance.pdf): Aventura, Bal Harbour, Bay Harbor Islands, Biscayne Park, Coral Gables, Cutler Bay, Doral, El Portal, Florida City, Golden Beach, Hialeah, Hialeah Gardens, Homestead, Indian Creek, Key Biscayne, Medley, Miami, Miami Beach, Miami Gardens, Miami Lakes, Miami Shores, Miami Springs, North Bay Village, North Miami, North Miami Beach, Opa-locka, Palmetto Bay, Pinecrest, South Miami, Sunny Isles Beach, Surfside, Sweetwater, Virginia Gardens and West Miami. The City of Miami is the largest municipality, followed by Hialeah, Miami Gardens, Miami Beach, North Miami and Coral Gables. Each municipality has its own government and provides city services such as police and zoning protection. 

(There is a [very snarky article by the Miami New Times](http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2014/09/here_are_all_34_cities_in_miami-dade_county_ranked_from_worst_to_best.php) which rank all 34 cities from worst to best; take with a grain of salt, but it gives a very quick impression on the variety of municipalities here.) 

The unincorporated areas of Miami-Dade County do not fall within the jurisdiction of a municipality. ([See the Muncipal Boundary dataset](http://gis.mdc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4e13f5bcf55d401b85ab85b90495ba50_0?geometry=-81.218%2C25.382%2C-79.241%2C26.039) on Miami-Dade County's GIS website.) With a population exceeding one million residents, the unincorporated area, if declared a city, would form the largest city in Florida and one of the largest in the nation.

* _Weather, Demographics, Urbanicity_
  * Weather: if you hate snow, congratulations! [Miami has two seasons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami#Climate): wet (May to November) and dry (November to May). When it's dry, expect a whole lot of pleasant shorts weather and people escaping New England and Chicago from freezing temperatures. When it's wet season, expect to hide in air-conditioned cars and get knocked over by a wall of humidity. As a bonus, wipe the condensation off your glasses every thirty minutes!
  * Urbanicity: Miami and its surrounding county is not dense compared to the big cities. Expect to drive most areas, although there are high density and walkability in particular areas: areas of Miami Beach (including South Beach and North Beach), Brickell, Coconut Grove and parts of Downtown Miami.
* _Is there a history of civic engagement? Does the city already have a Brigade?_
  * A [2011 National Conference on Citizen Report](http://www.bobgrahamcenter.ufl.edu/sites/default/files/minn._miami_report.pdf) listed Miami as the lowest civicly-engaged large city in the United States. While many factors contribute to what makes a city civicly enaged or not, [a report published by The Miami Foundation](http://ourmiami.org/stories/civic-participation/) pointed key things. Of interest: a high rate of residents (67.1%) born outside the state or abroad: "when people are new to a community, they may not know how to be civicly-engaged or they might not feel connected to the community to participate."


### Resources

* [Miami-Dade County GIS Open Data](http://gis.mdc.opendata.arcgis.com/)

* From Mike Sarasti: "[[This short movie is](http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/cultist/2014/11/right_to_wynwood_shows_some_truth_about_miamis_favorite_art_district_watch_it_here.php)] Relevant to our Wynwood visit and discussions about gentrification and under-served communities. Worth all 21 minutes of your day."

### Allies


* _Key city gov departments related to focus topic._
  * [Miami-Dade Community Information and Outreach](http://www.miamidade.gov/information/): [Mike Sarasti is a Program Manager](http://305biz.org/2014/09/29/mike-sarasti-on-open-data-fall-2014/) in this particular department at Miami-Dade County. He's also our municipal partner at Code for Miami and helped bring the Fellows program to the County, so I'm assuming he'll be our chief liason for the fellows. His boss is Henry Sori who is the director of the department.  
* _Community organizations currently active in focus topic, especially groups that can provide guidance and feedback._
  * [The Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/) is based in Miami and is thus a major player here trying to move the city forward. Most folks probably are familiar with the organization as they're a major supporter of Code for America, but they also offer local arts and community grants in Miami. [Program Director Matt Haggman](http://www.knightfoundation.org/staff/matt-haggman/) is a huge community champion and certainly one of the first people fellows should meet.
  * [The Miami Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/) "provides civic leadership, bringing stakeholders together to tackle issues of concern in our community." The person fellows will want to talk with is [Stuart Kennedy](http://miamifoundation.org/page.aspx?pid=620).
  * [The Beacon Council](http://www.beaconcouncil.com/): "As Miami-Dade County's official economic development partnership, The Beacon Council facilitates local, national and international business growth and expansion programs, helping companies of all sizes in diverse industries achieve their goals."
  * [The LAB Miami](http://thelabmiami.com/) was one of the first co-working spaces that opened up in Miami, and since has been seen as a third space for a combination of technology, young creatives, satellite remote workers, community programs and a whole lot of entrapeneurialism. Disclaimer: I (Ernie) have a space here so I am biased.
  * [VentureHive](http://www.venturehive.co/): Co-working space and accellerator. 
  * [Endeavor Miami](http://www.endeavormiami.org/): "Endeavor is the only non-profit that supports high-impact entrepreneurs around the world. Our 'mentor capitalist' model breaks down economic and cultural barriers to entrepreneurship through advising from our network of world-class business leaders." Matt Haggman could set up a proper intro to someone here if need be.
  * [The Idea Center at Miami Dade College](http://www.theideacenter.co/): Relatively new for MDC - which is the largest Junior College in the United States - "The Idea Center @MDC will [...] be the collegeâ€™s hub for entrepreneurship for 165,000 students. The center will also have a venture incubator, called CREATE, with programming and resources to help nurture and accelerate the entrepreneurial ideas and ventures of students." Worth note: CREATE's director is Wifredo Fernandez, one of the co-founders of LAB Miami. He's worth talking to.
  * [Refresh Miami](www.refreshmiami.com): there are many faces to Miami entrapeneurialism. Tech startups in Miami is nascent - still more "hustler" than "hacker" - but this is the networking group everyone goes to. Worth talking with its founder, Brian Breslin.
* _Local CfA brigade, civic hackers + former CfA fellows for guidance, feedback, getting up to speed._
  * [Code for Miami](http://www.codeformiami.org), local civic hacking brigade which meets every Monday at 7pm in the Wynwood Arts District. Co-captains are [Rebekah Monson](http://www.twitter.com/rsm) and [Cristina Solana](https://twitter.com/nightshiftc), replacing Ernie as he participates in the Fellows program.
