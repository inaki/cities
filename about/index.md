My name is Tyler Benziger. I am a web developer, father, and musician.

I work remotely for Adobe on a small team that focuses on validating and
prototyping new ideas. The flexibility of my team has given me some amazing
opportunities including working on projects like [jQuery
Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com),
[ThemeRoller](http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller), and
[Muse](http://adobe.com/muse).

I have an amazing family, including my beautiful wife Amy, my
two-and-a-half year-old son, Brody, and my one year-old daughter, Grace.

I've been playing music for about 12 years. I dabble in a lot of different
instruments but my true love is the electric guitar. I've played with
some fellow musicians on a few different projects (mostly for fun), but
my heart is in worship. I am apart of music ministry at a church called
[LifePoint](http://lifepointoakdale.org) in Oakdale, CA and it's
something about which I'm extremely passionate.

This is my blog where you'll find my rantings usually surrounding these
three topics.
